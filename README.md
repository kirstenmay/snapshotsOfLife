This app is to assist photographers in their delivery of photos to clients in a very user friendly, social media style platform. Built with C# .NETCore and React

As a photographer I find that there is no perfect website/application that easily allows me to book, communicate, deliver photos, and recieve payment for photoshoots. The idea of this app is to bring in my favorite features from other applications that I have used to make the most user friendly and photographer friendly experience possible. This is an open source project, I welcome all to contribute their desired features and ideas.

Desired features:

Have clients and photographers able to create accoutns (and refelect as such)
Allow users to find photographers in their local area
Allow clients and photographers to communicate via messaging/social media platform
Photographers will be able to dislay top 3 photos on their page to allow clients to see example work.
Have photographers set availability calendars for days that they can and cannot do photoshoots
Allow clients to book photo dates with photographers
Bring in PayPal/Venmo API so that clients can pay photographers directly through the app. (If a spcifiic photoshoot package is requires a despoit it will charge the client upon booking to lock in their spot on the calendar)
If the photoshoot is a package deal (A set time at a set price that guarentees a certain amount of photos returned) the photographer will be paid upon booking of the event.
If the photographer choses to upload more than the guarenteed photos (they guarentee 10 and return 15) they will be able to select the 10 photos that were part of the package deal and the other 5 will be available for purchase price per photo.
Clients and photographers can review each other after shoots and the results will be refelected on each of their profiles.
Allow online contracts to be signed upon booking.
